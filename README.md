Purpose
The purpose of this exercise was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is worth investing in. This challenge provided images that displayed in detail the behaviors of riders during the month of August. 
Summary 
To sum it up, the month of August appears to be really lucrative for bike-sharing companies in New York City. This makes sense as the weather permits and promotes physical activity amongst locals and tourists.
